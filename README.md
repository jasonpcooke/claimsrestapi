# Claimsrestapi (java practice)

## Project purpose
This project serves the purpose of practicing the basic creation of a java system using spring boot, maven, and postgresql. This project was assigned during down-time of my work's project and was given to me with the
intention of gaining knowledge in the areas of these languages and frameworks. This knowledge was needed in time for the start of some new project work.
This project's features cover those of a ReST API; the development of this project aims to cover the ReST principles. Part of the features also includes implementation of CRUD.

## Project Requirements and Dependencies
This project was built on java 21 and junit5.
* Spring Data JPA
* Spring Boot 3.x
* Spring Web
* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* PostgreSQL
* Lombok
## How to Set up and Run the Project
1. On a port of your choice, create a database connection named 'claims' (5432 is the default, change accordingly in applicatino.properties.
2. Run the application (ClaimsrestapiApplication).

Current functionality allows for requests to be used through HTTP methods- Postman is my tool of choice to perform such actions.
